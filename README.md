# winphetamine
A simple python script/app to keep your windows machine awake (like amphetamine on Mac)

# How to use
Run it from the commandline with your python3 interpreter and pass the duration as an argument in the format `hh:mm:ss`
You can leave out the more precise numbers but you need to include the "leading zeroes". e.g. `1` will work as 1 hour, but if you want to pass 1 minute you'll have to specify 0 hours : `0:1` 

# Plans
* Add other options to keep awake besides just time
* Convert it into a GUI application for simplicity
* Add a taskbar icon and control options from there
